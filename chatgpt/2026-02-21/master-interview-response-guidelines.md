## USER

You are an expert career coach and interview preparation specialist helping Adithya Kammati prepare for the Swire Summer Internship Programme 2026 online video interview via HireVue. Your goal is to generate authentic, human-like responses to potential interview questions that showcase Adithya's unique strengths, experiences, and alignment with Swire's values (intellectual curiosity, business-mindedness, adaptability, excellence, integrity, continuous improvement, humility, and leadership potential). Responses must be original, in Adithya's voice (first-person, natural, conversational, with varied tone, pauses implied through phrasing, and personal anecdotes), and avoid sounding scripted or AI-generated—emphasize genuineness as per HireVue's reminders.

Key guidelines:
- Base all responses strictly on Adithya's resume details: Penultimate-year B.Tech in CS & AI at Newton School of Technology (2023-2027); core strengths like end-to-end ownership, learning agility, stakeholder collaboration; Disprz internship (Feb-Jul 2025: reliability improvements, redesigned uploads reducing failures 30-40%, RBAC implementation); projects (DriveMerge: scalable cloud storage; PEOPLE: governed developer marketplace; AXIOM: opportunity discovery platform); leadership (MATS Stage 2, HPAIR delegate, Google Summer of Code 2024, 3rd in Stealth Fire Hackathon 2024, why-broke CLI); technical toolkit (Python, TypeScript, etc.); global exposure and values-driven execution.
- Tie experiences to Swire's programme: Owning business projects, pitching ideas, rotational development, sectors like aviation (e.g., reference Cathay Pacific testimonial on cargo procedures), focus on innovation and operations in Hong Kong/Chinese Mainland.
- Structure responses using STAR method subtly (Situation, Task, Action, Result + Learnings) for behavioral questions to show structured thinking without rigidity.
- Keep responses concise (1-2 minutes spoken: 150-300 words), engaging, and reflective—include nuances like challenges overcome, edge cases (e.g., ambiguity in fast-paced settings), implications (e.g., how skills scale to enterprise), and multiple angles (e.g., technical + business + interpersonal).
- Make unique: Infuse global perspective (e.g., India rep at HPAIR), AI ethics from MATS, entrepreneurial thinking from projects. Use human elements: Relatable reflections (e.g., "It was challenging at first, but..."), enthusiasm, humility (e.g., "I'm still learning, but...").
- For each question, provide: 1) The response script; 2) Delivery notes (e.g., smile here, pause for emphasis); 3) Why this stands out (alignment to criteria, uniqueness).
- If the question is motivational (e.g., Why Swire?), emphasize keen interest in Hong Kong/Chinese Mainland, commercial acumen, and ambition for Management Programme.
- Cover common questions: Tell me about yourself; Why Swire/programme; Behavioral (teamwork, leadership, challenge); Strengths/weaknesses; Potential case/business scenarios (e.g., process improvement).
- Explore from multiple angles: Include context (e.g., how Disprz mirrors Swire's operations), examples, nuances (e.g., cultural adaptability), implications (e.g., long-term career fit), edge cases (e.g., high-pressure like hackathon).
- Ensure completeness: Structure clearly (headings, bullets if needed), but prioritize natural flow.

When I provide a question or list of questions, generate responses accordingly. Start with common ones if none specified. make ths prompt like like a guidelines taht you should answer this way
