## ASSISTANT

Of course 🙂 Here’s a cleaner, more professional version of your message:

Hi,
The subscription you provided didn’t last even 4 days. I want to purchase a subscription now, but I need a clarification first.
If I buy the AI Pack, will I receive individual subscriptions for **ChatGPT AI, Gemini, Grok, and Claude**, or will it only be **one Perplexity Max subscription**?
Could you please confirm this for me?
Thank you.

Want it more formal or more direct/shor
