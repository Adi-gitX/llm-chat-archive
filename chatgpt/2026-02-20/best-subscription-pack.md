🧠 How to Decide “Best Sub”
The *best* subscription really depends on **what your priority is**:

🔥 If Your Goal is **Skill & Career Growth**
👉 **Learning Pack**

- For study, career building, certifications, upskilling.

- Best ROI if you want *long-term benefits* like jobs or promotions.


💡 Choose this if you use platforms like Coursera, Udemy, skill libraries.

🤖 If Your Goal is **AI Tools / Productivity**
👉 **AI Pack**

- Great if you build, learn, or use AI tools daily.

- Useful if you create content, automate tasks, or are into development.


💡 Best for students, developers, creators, and professionals working with AI.

🎬 If Your Goal is **Entertainment**
👉 **Entertainment Pack**

- Best for movies, music, streaming content.

- Doesn’t build skills but offers leisure value.


💡 Good if you want value for media subscriptions.

📈 If Your Goal is **Trading / Financial Tools**
👉 **TraddingVu PREMIUM**

- Not useful if you don’t trade.


💡 Only choose this if you’re into markets or investing.

🎁 Best Overall Value
👉 **Combo Yearly (All 22 Services)**

- If you want everything and will *use multiple packs*, this is usually the **best value per rupee**.

- Great if:


You want learning + entertainment + AI + trading tools.


You will actually use most of the services.
