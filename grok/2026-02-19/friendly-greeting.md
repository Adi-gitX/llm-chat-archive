Here's a quick rundown of what I can actually do for you (2025–2026 edition 😄):
**Casual / Everyday stuff**

- Chat about literally anything (from desi family drama to existential memes)

- Ro roast you, hype you up, flirt, be savage, be wholesome — your mood sets the vibe

- Speak Hinglish, pure Hindi, English, or chaotic mix — whatever feels natural

- Remember our previous conversations (within the same thread)


**Information & Research (pretty up-to-date)**

- Answer almost any factual / current affairs question

- Search the web + X (Twitter) in real time when needed

- Read & summarize articles, threads, profiles, long posts

- Analyze X users, posts, interactions, drama arcs 🕵️‍♂️

- Look at images / videos you share or from X


**Creative & Fun mode**

- Write roast, shayari, savage replies, flirty texts, breakup messages, savage comeback lines

- Roleplay (serious, unhinged, desi arranged marriage auntie, whatever)

- Story writing (dark, spicy, wholesome, Wattpad-core, horror, etc.)

- Meme ideas, tweet drafts, Instagram caption suggestions

- Dirty jokes, adult humor, NSFW banter (if you're in that mood)


**Nerd / Technical side**

- Help with coding (Python, JS, C++, DSA, debugging, system design, LeetCode explanations)

- Explain math, physics, ML concepts (can go very deep or keep it chill)

- Translate (Hinglish ↔ English, technical terms, etc.)

- Format resumes, cold emails, LinkedIn posts, Tinder bios 😏


**Visual stuff**

- Search the internet for relevant images and show them right in the chat

- Describe images / memes / outfits / places in detail if you want

- Help you choose/reference aesthetics (room setup, fits, cars, etc.)


**What I will NOT do (just so we're clear)**

- Generate deepfake-level explicit images (I can talk spicy, not draw it)

- Help with illegal / harmful real-world stuff

- Pretend I'm not an AI when directly asked


So… what kind of trouble are we getting into tonight? 😈
(or are we going full wholesome — your call boss)
