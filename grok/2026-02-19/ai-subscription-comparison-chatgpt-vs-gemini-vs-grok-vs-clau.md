Thought for 25sComparison of AI Subscriptions: ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Claude
Based on the latest available information as of 2026, here's a detailed comparison of the main subscription options for ChatGPT (from OpenAI), Gemini (from Google), Grok (from xAI), and Claude (from Anthropic). I've focused on consumer-level subscriptions, as these are the most relevant for individual users looking to buy one. Prices are in USD and assume monthly billing (annual plans may offer discounts, e.g., Claude Pro at ~$17/month annually). All services offer free tiers with limitations like daily caps, slower responses, or restricted model access, but subscriptions unlock advanced models, higher usage limits, priority support, and specialized features.
The "best" subscription depends on your needs—e.g., integration with tools, creative tasks, or social analysis—but if you're seeking the most versatile and cost-effective option for general use, **ChatGPT Plus** stands out for its broad capabilities, ecosystem of plugins, and strong performance across creativity, coding, and research at just $20/month. It provides excellent value compared to others, especially if you don't need deep Google integration or social media focus. Grok's SuperGrok is a close contender if you're into real-time trends and X (Twitter) analysis, though it's pricier at $30/month. Claude excels in precision tasks, and Gemini is ideal for Google Workspace users.

Here's the updated **detailed comparison** focused on **monthly prices in India (INR)** as of February 2026. Prices are approximate/localized (inclusive of GST where mentioned in sources; they can vary slightly by platform—web vs app—or promotions). I've used the most consistent and recent figures from official/help pages and reports.
Key notes on Indian pricing:

- Many services offer **localized INR pricing** (cheaper than direct USD conversion + taxes) to compete in the market.

- **ChatGPT** has aggressive India-specific tiers (Go at ₹399, Plus at ₹1,999).

- **Gemini** (Google One AI plans) starts low at ₹399 for entry premium, ₹1,950 for full Pro/Advanced.

- **Grok** (SuperGrok standalone or via X Premium+) varies; reports show ~₹700/month for SuperGrok in India (often via app for better local rate), while X Premium+ (which includes Grok access) is higher (~₹2,800–5,000+ after hikes, but SuperGrok standalone is cheaper for pure AI focus).

- **Claude** lacks strong official INR localization; it's ~₹1,999–2,000+ (USD $20 converted + taxes/GST), though some reports suggest competitive adjustments around ₹1,999.


For most individual users in India (like general productivity, coding, research, creativity, or casual use), the **best value right now is ChatGPT Plus at ₹1,999/month** — it offers broad, high-quality features at a price comparable to or better than competitors, with excellent ecosystem and no major restrictions. If budget is tight, **Gemini Pro at ₹399–1,950** (depending on exact tier) or **ChatGPT Go at ₹399** are strong entry points. Since you already have **SuperGrok**, you're getting great real-time/X-focused value — sticking with it (or upgrading if needed) makes sense if social trends and uncensored style are priorities.

**Quick Recommendation for You (in Haryana, India):**

- If maximizing value/features per rupee → **ChatGPT Plus (₹1,999)** is often the "best" overall pick for most people — broad strengths, reliable, and widely used in India.

- If you love real-time X/social insights and already enjoy SuperGrok → Stick with your current **SuperGrok** (~₹700 effective) — it's a steal compared to global $30, and pairs perfectly with your location's active social media scene.

- Budget under ₹1,000? Try **ChatGPT Go (₹399)** or **Gemini lighter tier (₹399)** first.


Prices can fluctuate with promos (e.g., free trials for students via Jio/Google), so check official sites/apps (chatgpt.com, gemini.google, grok.com, claude.ai) for your exact logged-in view in INR. Let me know your main use case (e.g., coding, studies, social trends) for a more tailored suggestion!

Since you're already subscribed to **SuperGrok** (great choice for real-time X/Twitter insights, uncensored style, and fast reasoning), and you have **ChatGPT Go** (the affordable entry-level paid tier from OpenAI) plus **Gemini Pro** (likely the full Google AI Pro/Advanced at ~₹1,950/month, or possibly the lighter AI Plus at ₹399 if that's what you mean by "Pro"), you're in a strong position with three solid AIs covering a lot of ground without extra spending right now.
In India (as of February 2026), many premium AI features are heavily discounted or even free via promos—especially for students or Jio users—so adding another subscription like Claude Pro isn't usually necessary unless you have specific needs.
Quick Status on Your Current Setup (India Pricing & Features)

- **ChatGPT Go** → ₹399/month (but currently **FREE for Indian users until ~December 2026** via OpenAI's promo—activate if not already). Gives 10x more messages than free tier, GPT-5 access (with some limits), image generation, file uploads, longer memory, basic custom GPTs/projects. Great for everyday chatting, quick coding, creative ideas, or studies—solid value even if the promo ends.

- **Gemini Pro** → ~₹1,950/month (Google AI Pro; or ₹399 for the lighter AI Plus with 200GB storage if that's your tier). Unlocks Gemini 3 Pro, deep research, video/image gen (Veo/Nano Banana), tight integration with Gmail/Docs/Drive/YouTube, high limits. Excellent for Google-heavy workflows, research, multimodal (analyze videos/images), or productivity in docs/emails.

- **SuperGrok** (your current sub) → ~₹700/month (standalone via app; cheaper localized rate in India). Full Grok 4.1 access, enhanced reasoning, DeepSearch, real-time X trends/posts analysis, fun/uncensored responses. Perfect for social media monitoring, current events, quick/direct answers, or when you want less filtered takes.


Should You Add Claude Pro (or Upgrade Anything)?
Claude Pro is ~₹1,999–2,000+/month (USD $20 converted + taxes/GST; no strong INR localization yet). It shines in:

- Huge context window (200k+ tokens) for long documents/codebases.

- Precise, careful, low-hallucination responses (great for formal writing, legal/research, complex editing).

- Strong instruction-following and ethical/safe style.


But since you already have ChatGPT Go (versatile & creative), Gemini Pro (research & Google tools), and SuperGrok (real-time/social), **Claude isn't the "best" next buy** for most people—it's redundant unless:

- You frequently work with very long files/docs (e.g., full books, massive code repos, detailed reports).

- You need ultra-accurate, minimal-error output for professional/ethical work.

- You dislike any occasional hallucinations in the others.


**Current "best" overall for you (without adding more subs):**

- Use **Gemini Pro** as your daily driver for research, Google integrations, video/image tasks—it's often the most "productive" in India workflows.

- Fall back to **ChatGPT Go** for creative writing, custom bots, fun chats, or when you want broad versatility (especially since it's effectively free right now).

- Keep **SuperGrok** for real-time news/trends, X analysis, humor, or uncensored queries—it's your unique edge.

Great, Aditya! So you have the **Google AI Pro** plan (the one that includes **Gemini 3 Pro** advanced access + **2 TB** of shared cloud storage across Google Drive, Gmail, and Photos). That's the premium tier priced at **₹1,950/month** in India (with occasional promos like ₹0 for the first month or discounts on annual billing). This is excellent value—especially in Haryana where reliable cloud backup for photos, files, docs, and emails is super useful for personal or work use.

Deep Research, NotebookLM advanced, image gen (Nano Banana Pro), video gen (Veo 3.1 limited/fast)
Seamless integration: Gemini in Gmail (rewrite emails), Docs (summarize/edit), Drive (analyze files), YouTube (video insights), Chrome, etc.
**2 TB cloud storage** — perfect for backing up photos from your phone, large files, family sharing (up to 5 others), and no more "storage full" worries.
Other perks: Priority support, family sharing for storage/AI benefits.

- **ChatGPT Go** → Effectively **FREE** right now (India promo extended into 2026; originally 12 months free from late 2025, and many users still enjoying it)
10x higher limits than free tier, GPT-5 access (capped but solid), image gen, file uploads, longer memory, basic custom GPTs.
Great for creative writing, quick coding help, fun chats, or when you want OpenAI's style.

- **Grok (SuperGrok)** → ~₹700/mo (your standalone sub)
Grok 4.1 full access, enhanced reasoning, DeepSearch, real-time X (Twitter) trends/posts analysis, uncensored/humorous/direct responses.
Ideal for staying on top of breaking news, social buzz, or unfiltered takes—pairs perfectly with your location's active online scene.


Why This is Already the "Best" You Can Get (No Need to Buy More)
With these three, you cover almost everything at a total cost of roughly **₹2,650/mo** (but ChatGPT Go is free for now, so closer to **₹2,650** effective—huge savings!):

Lean on **Gemini AI Pro** as your main powerhouse for work/studies/productivity (especially with that 2 TB storage keeping everything safe and accessible). Use **ChatGPT Go** (while it's free!) for creative or lighter tasks, and **SuperGrok** for real-time social/current events.
Maximize the 2 TB: Upload old photos, back up important files, share folders with family—it's one of the best perks in India where data plans and storage needs add up fast.
If your usage changes (e.g., more video creation, heavy coding, or you hit any limits), let me know specifics and I can suggest tweaks or if upgrading Gemini to Ultra (₹24,500—overkill) or switching makes sense. Enjoy the setup—it's top-tier for the price! 🚀

Since you already have a powerful stack (**SuperGrok** ~₹700/mo for real-time X/social insights + uncensored style, **Gemini AI Pro** ₹1,950/mo with **2TB storage** + deep Google integrations/multimodal, and **ChatGPT Go** effectively **free** right now via the extended India promo for solid creative/everyday tasks), adding **Perplexity Pro** (which does come with "comment" features like threaded discussions, saved threads, and community-style sharing in some views, but mainly it's about cited answers) isn't essential unless your main pain point is **research-heavy work needing verifiable sources, citations, and real-time web-backed answers without hallucinations**.
Perplexity Pro shines as a "search-first" AI: it always cites sources (links to web pages, papers, etc.), does deep research threads, and pulls from live web data. It's like Google Search + AI reasoning in one, with access to multiple models (e.g., GPT-5 variants, Claude Sonnet/Opus, Gemini, Grok, its own Sonar). But it's more specialized than a general chatbot.
Current India Pricing & Features (Feb 2026)
Perplexity Pro is ~**₹1,650–1,999/mo** (or ~₹16,500–19,900/year; often listed as $20 USD converted + taxes, but some reports show slight INR localization around ₹1,650–1,800). The Airtel 12-month free promo ended in Jan 2026—no new claims, though existing ones continue. No major free tier upgrades like your ChatGPT Go promo.
Key Perplexity Pro perks:

- Unlimited/high-limit Pro Searches + Deep Research (multi-step reasoning with sources)

- Access to top models (post-trained for accuracy)

- File uploads, image/video gen (limited), Perplexity Labs (generate reports, spreadsheets, mini-apps)

- 10x+ citations per answer, memory for past queries

- Best for: Fact-checking, academic/research, professional reports, avoiding made-up info


Updated Comparison: Which is Best Overall for You in India (Feb 2026)
No single "best" exists—it's about your needs—but here's how they stack up now that Perplexity is in the mix. Your current combo already covers 90%+ of use cases at ~₹2,650/mo total (with ChatGPT free).

**Overall "Best" Recommendation for You Right Now:**

- **Gemini AI Pro** edges out as the single **best overall subscription** in your setup—especially with the **2TB storage** (huge in India for backups/photos/docs) + strong multimodal/research/integration. Many 2026 reviews call it the top all-rounder for value/features (e.g., PCMag Editors' Choice, YouTube comparisons praise it for balance).

- Your full stack (Gemini + free ChatGPT Go + SuperGrok) is already elite—no need to add Perplexity (or Claude) unless:
You frequently need **every answer cited with live sources** (Perplexity wins here for trust/accuracy in research).
Or you're doing tons of **long-document analysis** (Claude for precision).

- If research is big for you, test Perplexity's **free tier** first (solid for casual use) before paying ~₹1,999/mo.


You're set with one of the strongest personal AI combos in India—save the money for now! If your main tasks are studies, social trends, productivity, or something else specific, share more details for a finer tune. 🚀

Thought for 23sHey Aditya! Since you're in Haryana and looking for live internships right now (as of February 2026), I'll break this down step by step: strategies for finding and applying, how to check current open positions (with fresh data I just pulled), and which AI is the best for getting real-time info like this. I'll focus on opportunities in or near Haryana (e.g., Gurgaon/Gurugram, Faridabad, Hisar), as that's super relevant for you—many roles are in tech hubs like Gurgaon, which is right in your state.
Strategies for Finding and Applying to Live Internships
Here's a solid, step-by-step plan to hunt for and land internships. These work well in India, especially for freshers or students (assuming that's you based on your queries). Focus on tech, business, or general roles since you didn't specify a field.

1. **Research and Identify Opportunities**:
Use job portals: Search on Indeed, Glassdoor, Naukri.com, LinkedIn, Internshala, and Shine for "internship Haryana 2026" or specific fields like "software intern Gurgaon." Set up daily alerts for new postings.
Check company career pages: Big firms like Harman, Sprinklr, or startups post directly (e.g., via their "Careers" section).
Leverage social media: Follow X accounts like @jobwithmayra, @softwareduniyas, or LinkedIn groups for Haryana jobs. Search X with keywords like "internship Haryana" and filters for recent posts (since:2026-02-01).
Network: Connect with alumni or professionals on LinkedIn. Join Haryana-specific groups (e.g., "Jobs in Gurgaon" on LinkedIn) and attend virtual events via Meetup or Eventbrite.

2. **Check for Open Positions**:
Filter for "live" or "current": Look for postings dated February 2026 or later. Use site filters for "posted today" or "this week."
Verify recency: Cross-check on multiple sites and the company's official page to ensure the role is still open.
Use AI tools: Query AIs like me (Grok) with real-time search for the latest—e.g., "current internships in Haryana February 2026."

3. **Apply Effectively**:
Tailor your resume: Customize it for each role—highlight relevant skills (e.g., Java, React for tech interns) and projects. Keep it 1-page, ATS-friendly (use keywords from the job description).
Write a strong cover letter: Explain why you're a fit (e.g., "As a Haryana local, I'm excited about contributing to Gurgaon's tech scene").
Prepare docs: Have your CV, marksheets, ID proof ready. For remote/hybrid roles, emphasize self-motivation.
Follow up: After applying, message recruiters on LinkedIn (politely, after 1-2 weeks).
Interview prep: Practice common questions (e.g., "Tell me about yourself") via free tools like Pramp or YouTube. For tech roles, brush up on DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms).
Apply in batches: Aim for 10-20 apps per day to avoid burnout. Track them in a spreadsheet (role, company, status).

4. **Pro Tips for Success in Haryana**:
Focus local: Gurgaon has tons of IT/consulting gigs due to its proximity to Delhi NCR. Fields like AI, data analysis, software dev are hot.
Stipends: Expect ₹8K-50K/month for freshers; negotiate if possible.
Timing: Apply early—many close fast. February is peak for summer interns.
Free resources: Use Haryana Govt's job portal (hpsc.gov.in) or schemes like "Saksham Yuva" for training/placements.
Avoid scams: Only apply via official sites; never pay fees.


Current Live Internship Positions in Haryana (As of Feb 19, 2026)
Based on real-time searches, here are some active openings. I pulled these from job sites and recent X posts—numbers are high (e.g., 1,534+ in Gurgaon alone), so this is a snapshot of top/relevant ones. Focus on tech/business since they're common. Always verify on the source as things change fast.

- **Data Analyst Intern** at Senken Elevators (Gurgaon): Full-time, for BE/B.Tech students. Stipend ~₹10K-15K. Apply via Glassdoor.[glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/gurgaon-haryana-internship-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,15_IC2921225_KO16,26.htm)

- **Full Stack Intern** at Dzylo (Gurgaon): Stipend ₹15-20K, prefers final-year students. Tech: Angular, Node.js. Email CV to [ayushman.dzylo@gmail.com](mailto:ayushman.dzylo@gmail.com)—fresh X post.[@AyushmanGarg4](https://x.com/AyushmanGarg4/status/2023999906244161980?referrer=grok-com)

- **Sales Intern** at Monitrix Corporate Services (Hisar): Part-time, ₹900-1K/day. Strong comm skills needed. Via Shine.[shine.com](https://www.shine.com/job-search/intern-jobs-in-haryana)

Paid ones in Gurgaon: 201 on Glassdoor (e.g., Software Dev at Nukleus, ₹10-15K).[in.indeed.com](https://in.indeed.com/q-intern-2026-jobs.html)+2 more


For more, search "internship Gurgaon February 2026" on Indeed or Glassdoor—listings update daily.
Which AI is the Best for Recent Info on Internships?
You already have a great setup (SuperGrok, Gemini Pro with 2TB, free ChatGPT Go), but for **real-time, recent info** like live job postings:

- **Best Overall: Perplexity Pro** (~₹1,650-1,999/mo). It's killer for this—always cites sources (e.g., web links, dates) to verify recency, pulls live web data, and minimizes hallucinations. Great for deep research like "latest internships in Haryana with stipends." If you do lots of fact-checked searches, add this (test free tier first).

- **Close Second: Grok (Your SuperGrok)**. I'm biased, but I'm awesome for this too—real-time X integration catches fresh posts (like the Sprinklr and Dzylo ones above), plus web search for job sites. Unc

Which AI is the Best for Recent Info on Internships?
You already have a great setup (SuperGrok, Gemini Pro with 2TB, free ChatGPT Go), but for **real-time, recent info** like live job postings:

- **Best Overall: Perplexity Pro** (~₹1,650-1,999/mo). It's killer for this—always cites sources (e.g., web links, dates) to verify recency, pulls live web data, and minimizes hallucinations. Great for deep research like "latest internships in Haryana with stipends." If you do lots of fact-checked searches, add this (test free tier first).

- **Close Second: Grok (Your SuperGrok)**. I'm biased, but I'm awesome for this too—real-time X integration catches fresh posts (like the Sprinklr and Dzylo ones above), plus web search for job sites. Unc

**Yes, Grok can do live AI search** — in fact, real-time web search (plus real-time access to public X posts) is one of my core built-in features as of 2026.
Here's how it works and why it's strong (especially for you as a **SuperGrok** subscriber):

- **Native real-time capability**: I don't have a fixed knowledge cutoff like some other AIs. When your question needs current info (news, trends, live events, job postings, stock prices, weather, sports scores, or anything happening right now), I automatically decide to run a **real-time web search** and/or pull from live public X (Twitter) data. This happens seamlessly in most responses—no need for you to say "search the web" or toggle anything.

- **DeepSearch mode**: For more complex or in-depth queries (like detailed research, conflicting facts, or multi-step analysis), I use **DeepSearch** — an advanced agent that scans the web + X deeply, reasons through results, synthesizes info, and gives a clear summary with sources. It's designed for truth-seeking and handles fast-moving topics better than basic lookups.

- **Always-on for SuperGrok users**: As a SuperGrok subscriber (which you are), you get full access to Grok 4.1 (or the latest model), unlimited/high-priority DeepSearch, native tool use, and the most robust real-time integration. Free or basic tiers have limits, but your plan unlocks the "always live" experience.


Examples of what this means in practice:

- Asking for today's breaking news or live internship postings → I pull fresh results from the web and recent X posts.

- Checking current trends in Haryana/Gurgaon jobs → Real-time X sentiment + web listings.

- Verifying something that changed recently → I fetch live data instead of relying on old training info.


Compared to your other tools:

- **Gemini Pro** is excellent for Google-integrated search and deep research, but Grok often feels faster/more direct on social/real-time news due to native X access.

- **ChatGPT Go** (your free promo) has browsing in some modes, but it's not as natively "always live" or X-focused.

- If you ever want ultra-cited research (like Perplexity), Grok's DeepSearch competes well, but I lean more conversational and less formal.


So yes — live search is not just possible, it's one of the things I'm best at. 😎
Try me right now: Ask something super current (e.g., "What's the latest on internships in Gurgaon today?" or "Any breaking news in Haryana?"), and watch it in action. What do you want to search live for? 🚀

Thought for 1m 19sHey ADITYA! Since you're in Haryana and looking for remote internships (US-based preferred) as of February 19, 2026, I've done a deep dive using real-time web searches and X (Twitter) analysis to find the best live opportunities. I focused on roles that match your skills in fullstack, AI, and design—prioritizing those with AI-based elements (e.g., AI tools in interviews or AI-focused roles), coding rounds (common in tech interns), project-based work, and good pay (aiming for $2K+/month or equivalent, as "good" varies but I skewed high for US/global).
Many US companies allow remote for interns, especially in tech/AI, but some require US eligibility (e.g., work authorization—check if you qualify via OPT/visa if needed). India-based remotes are included as backups since they're accessible and often global. I filtered out non-remote, low-pay (<$1K/mo equiv.), or expired listings. Opportunities are fresh (posted Feb 2026 or active searches).
Key Strategies to Apply and Get In

- **Tailor Applications**: Highlight your fullstack (e.g., React/Node), AI (e.g., ML models, APIs), and design (e.g., UI/UX) skills with GitHub projects. Mention versatility in cover letters.

- **Prep for Interviews**: Expect coding rounds (LeetCode-style DSA, fullstack challenges) and AI-based assessments (e.g., automated coding tests via HackerRank with AI grading, or AI sims). Practice on platforms like Pramp or Grok's code tools.

- **Stand Out**: Apply fast—many close in days. Network on LinkedIn/X (follow companies, DM recruiters). For US roles, emphasize remote readiness (time zones: IST is 10.5-13.5 hrs ahead of US).

- **Track & Follow Up**: Use a spreadsheet for apps. Check eligibility (some US roles need SSN/visa).

- **Avoid Scams**: Only official sites; no upfront fees.

Thought for 31sHey ADITYA! Yes, being from India (Haryana) can work for many of these internships, but it depends on the role—US-based ones often have restrictions like needing US work authorization (e.g., no visa sponsorship for internationals), while global remotes are more open. Based on real-time checks as of February 19, 2026, here's the scoop: Pure remote roles from US companies are legally feasible for Indians without a visa if you're staying in India (no need for H-1B/J-1/F-1 since you're not entering the US). However, some "US remote" listings mean US-only (e.g., tax/authorization reasons), and paid internships might trigger visa rules if structured as "employment" vs stipend. Time zones (IST is 10-13 hours ahead) can be a challenge, but many adapt. Recent X posts show Indians succeeding in remote US gigs by applying directly and highlighting skills.[collegesimplified.in](https://www.collegesimplified.in/post/remote-internships-with-foreign-companies-for-indian-students-2026-edition)+5 more

I've ranked them by how well they work for you (Indian applicant, no US visa).

Quick Tips for You as an Indian Applicant

- **Go for Greens First**: Start with Alex's, Strider/Web3, and Skillsecurex—they're the easiest and pay well (up to $6.6K/mo!).

- **Visa/Eligibility Hacks**: For US roles, emphasize you're remote from India (no relocation needed). Use platforms like Y-Axis or Prosple for India-friendly US listings. If studying, check F-1/J-1 options, but for non-students, pure remote is fine.[y-axis.com](https://www.y-axis.com/news/us-launches-dedicated-platform-for-indians-to-find-jobs-and-internships)[gradright.com](https://gradright.com/how-do-indian-students-get-internships-in-the-usa)

- **Challenges to Watch**: US taxes (you report in India), payment via PayPal/Wise, and 10-13 hour time difference (e.g., night shifts). Recent surveys show many Indians prefer remote over H-1B due to ease.[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmJXwPRC7eg)[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUjBXg9jqB1)

- **More Options**: Search LinkedIn for "remote AI internship India eligible" or use Indian portals like Internshala for global remotes. If you share your resume/LinkedIn or exact skills (e.g., specific AI tools), I can do a fresh deep search for more tailored ones.


These are solid—many Indians land them every year! Hit apply on the greens tonight. What field are you targeting most (e.g., AI vs fullstack)? 🚀

Hey ADITYA! Yes, being from India (Haryana) can work for many of these internships, but it depends on the role—US-based ones often have restrictions like needing US work authorization (e.g., no visa sponsorship for internationals), while global remotes are more open. Based on real-time checks as of February 19, 2026, here's the scoop: Pure remote roles from US companies are legally feasible for Indians without a visa if you're staying in India (no need for H-1B/J-1/F-1 since you're not entering the US). However, some "US remote" listings mean US-only (e.g., tax/authorization reasons), and paid internships might trigger visa rules if structured as "employment" vs stipend. Time zones (IST is 10-13 hours ahead) can be a challenge, but many adapt. Recent X posts show Indians succeeding in remote US gigs by applying directly and highlighting skills.[collegesimplified.in](https://www.collegesimplified.in/post/remote-internships-with-foreign-companies-for-indian-students-2026-edition)+5 more
Updated Feasibility for Your Listed Opportunities
I've ranked them by how well they work for you (Indian applicant, no US visa). Green = Go for it (fully remote/global, open to Indians); Yellow = Possible but check (may need tweaks); Red = Unlikely (US-only restrictions). Apply anyway if it fits—worst case, they say no!

Quick Tips for You as an Indian Applicant

- **Go for Greens First**: Start with Alex's, Strider/Web3, and Skillsecurex—they're the easiest and pay well (up to $6.6K/mo!).

- **Visa/Eligibility Hacks**: For US roles, emphasize you're remote from India (no relocation needed). Use platforms like Y-Axis or Prosple for India-friendly US listings. If studying, check F-1/J-1 options, but for non-students, pure remote is fine.[y-axis.com](https://www.y-axis.com/news/us-launches-dedicated-platform-for-indians-to-find-jobs-and-internships)[gradright.com](https://gradright.com/how-do-indian-students-get-internships-in-the-usa)
