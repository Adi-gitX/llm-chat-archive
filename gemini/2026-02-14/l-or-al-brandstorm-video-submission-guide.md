## ASSISTANT

Here is a complete video concept and script for your L'Oréal Brandstorm "Team Presentation" submission.Since your team name is listed as **Éclat Labs** (meaning "brilliance" or "burst"), this concept plays on that theme—presenting your team as a fusion of different energies coming together.**Video Concept: "The Alchemy of Éclat"**- **Style:** Documentary/Vlog hybrid. Fast cuts, energetic background music, mixing "talking head" shots with B-roll of you working (brainstorming, sketching, coding, arguing playfully, high-fiving).
- **Setting:** A collaborative space (library, coffee shop, or a dorm room setup to look like a "Lab").
- **Duration:** 3 Minutes (approx. 450-500 words at a natural pace).
- **The Team:****Aditya (You):** The Tech/Structure Lead (Since you are in AI/CS).**Teammate 2:** The Creative/Design Lead.**Teammate 3:** The Strategy/Market Lead.
**Full Video Transcript****(0:00-0:25) INTRO: Who We Are***(Visual: Fast montage of the team working. Quick cuts of sticky notes, laptop screens, and coffee cups. Music starts with a strong beat.)***All Together:** We are Éclat Labs!**Aditya:** Hi, I’m Aditya. I’m the builder—bridging the gap between code and reality.**Teammate 2:** I’m [Name], the designer. I turn complex ideas into visual stories.**Teammate 3:** And I’m [Name], the strategist. I make sure our wild ideas actually fit the market.**Aditya:** We aren't just three students; we are a lab of colliding perspectives. We're here to show you exactly how we operate.**(0:25-0:55) Q1: JUDGMENT (Decision Making)***(Visual: Shot of the team looking at a whiteboard filled with two opposing ideas. Someone circles one options decisively.)***Teammate 3 (Strategist):** Complex situations are where we thrive. When we faced a crossroads on our core feature, we couldn't rely on guessing.**Aditya:** We adopted a "Data over Ego" policy. We didn't ask "Who is right?" we asked "What works?"**Teammate 3:** We used rapid A/B testing on a small scale. My gut said 'A', Aditya’s data said 'B'.**Aditya:** We went with B. It wasn't about winning an argument; it was about trusting the evidence to guide our judgment.**(0:55-1:25) Q2: RESILIENCE (Hurdles)***(Visual: B-Roll of the team looking tired, head in hands, maybe a clock showing late night. Then, a shot of someone bringing snacks and the energy shifting.)***Teammate 2 (Designer):** But it wasn't a straight line. Halfway through, we realized our initial design for the user journey was completely technically unfeasible. It was a massive blocker.**Aditya:** Honestly? We panicked for about an hour. But then we pivoted.**Teammate 2:** We stripped the idea down to its "MVP" (Minimum Viable Product). We realized the hurdle wasn't the tech; it was our own over-complication.**Aditya:** We overcame it by simplifying. We turned a wall into a door just by changing our perspective.**(1:25-1:55) Q3: AMBITION (Vision)***(Visual: The team sitting outside or looking out a window, speaking passionately. Slower, more inspiring music swells.)***Teammate 3 (Strategist):** Our vision for Éclat Labs isn't just to win a competition.**Aditya:** We looked at the fragrance market and saw a gap in personalization. Our long-term goal is to democratize how people experience scent using technology.**Teammate 2:** We want to build something that lasts beyond this semester. A solution that feels human, but scales globally. That is the ambition driving every slide in our pitch.**(1:55-2:25) Q4: EMPATHY (Support)***(Visual: Genuine footage of the team laughing. Maybe sharing food or one person helping another fix a tie/collar.)***Aditya:** High ambition comes with high stress. That's where empathy comes in.**Teammate 2:** We have a rule: "Life happens." When I had a deadline clash with exams, the team didn't just push me to work harder—they took my load.**Teammate 3:** We support each other by listening. We do daily check-ins not just on *work*, but on *wellness*. We know that a burnt-out team can't build a brilliant product.**(2:25-2:50) Q5: LEARNING AGILITY (Unfamiliar Topics)***(Visual: Shot of Aditya reading a book about Fragrance chemistry or Teammate 3 looking at AI code. Showing cross-learning.)***Aditya:** Coming from a tech background, I knew nothing about "olfactory notes" or the fragrance supply chain.**Teammate 3:** And I had never looked at a line of code in my life.**Aditya:** We had to be agile. We taught each other. I gave a crash course on tech feasibility; they gave me a masterclass in consumer psychology.**Teammate 2:** We didn't shy away from what we didn't know. We attacked it. We turned our ignorance into our learning curve.**(2:50-3:00) OUTRO***(Visual: Team standing together, confident smile.)***Aditya:** Resilience. Empathy. Agility.**Teammate 2:** We are ready to disrupt.**All Together:** We are Éclat Labs. See you at Brandstorm!*(Fade to Black with Team Name & Logo)***Filming Tips for "Éclat Labs"**1. **Audio is Key:** Use a quiet room. If you don't have a mic, use a second phone recorded close to the speaker as a "voice memo" and sync it later.
2. **Lighting:** Face a window. Natural light is your best friend.
3. **B-Roll:** Spend 20 minutes acting out "working scenes" (typing, pointing at screens, drawing). You will overlay these while you are talking so the video isn't just 3 minutes of staring at faces.
4. **Adobe Express:** Since you have the license, use it to add simple captions for the 5 keywords (e.g., when you talk about Resilience, have the word **RESILIENCE** appear on screen).
**Would you like me to generate a checklist of B-roll shots you should film to match this script?**
